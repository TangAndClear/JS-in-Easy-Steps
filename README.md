# JS-in-Easy-Steps
working through the book by Mike McGrath

20 Aug 2022 1:51PM update: 
When I launch chap9.html and click the button, I get this error:

    chap9.js:13 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getElementsByTagName')
        at getData (chap9.js:13:25)
        at xmlhttp.onreadystatechange (chap9.js:7:9)
    
Is my issue with the XML being on GitHub?
NOTE: The JS code I have matches the book exactly, so I'm not sure where I'm wrong. I appreciate any help. ty!
